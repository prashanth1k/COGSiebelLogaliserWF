## NOTE
I have moved away from Siebel and desktop programming.
Feel free to copy the code and use it for your own purposes. No guarantees that this will not power down the grid though.

## About
This is a simple log analysis file for Siebel applications.
Works on Siebel 8.1, at least used to.
See [https://crmcog.com/free-tool-to-analyse-siebel-log-files/](https://crmcog.com/free-tool-to-analyse-siebel-log-files/) for details.

## Technologies
VB.NET, Dotnet 4.8.
Yes, this is old.
