Purpose
-------
	SiebelLogaliser is a utility to quickly analyse Siebel logs. 
	The program can read and parse spool files, and log files generated 
	by Siebel client or Siebel server components. It extracts useful 
	information about SQL/Siebel performance and errors in a table 
	format. If you don't know much about Siebel - Oracle's flagship
	CRM product, this program does not make sense.

	Log files provide crucial information to debug errors and 
	performance issues for any Siebel developer. However as in case
	of any log files, Siebel log files needs some 'getting used to'
	and needs ability to parse huge chunks of text. This utlility 
	is an attempt to do the parsing for the user and display the 
	observations in a format that is (hopefully) better readable.
	The program reads spool files (generated through the /s
	argument) or log files, and display the content of interest in 
	a tabular structure. 

	
Usage
-----
	SiebelLogaliser is distributed in a binary version. Double 
	click the exe file to start the program, select the Siebel spool 
	file or log file of interest and watch the program process. There 
	is really nothing more to it. The program is tested on 
	Windows 7 64 bit and Windows 8 64 bit operating systems.
